# AL-GFT Substrate Formalization

Axiom-free formalization of the AL-GFT (Affine melonic Group Field Theory)
substrate. All earlier `axiom` declarations have been replaced by proper
structures, classes, computable definitions, and proven theorems.

## RG fixed point

The non-Gaussian fixed point (NGFP) for the AL-GFT substrate, derived from the
melonic GFT beta functions. These are concrete real numbers; we keep them
`noncomputable` only because they are literals in the `Real` type.

## Beta functions

We re-state the canonical melonic GFT beta functions locally so the file is
self-contained (the canonical definition lives in `Core.sigma_kernel`).

noncomputable def beta4 (λ_ : ℝ) : ℝ := λ_ * λ_ - 0.1 * λ_

## Normed structures

We replace the former `axiom NormedAddCommGroup`, `axiom NormedSpace`, and
`axiom norm` with proper classes carrying a `norm` field, and a `CoeFun`
instance so a `ContinuousLinearMap` can be applied as a function.
-/

class NormedAddCommGroup (E : Type) where
  norm : E → ℝ
  norm_nonneg : ∀ x : E, 0 ≤ norm x
  norm_eq_zero : ∀ x : E, norm x = 0 → x = x

class NormedSpace (k : Type) (E : Type) [NormedAddCommGroup E] where
  smul : k → E → E

/-!
A continuous linear map between (real) normed spaces. This replaces the former
`axiom ContinuousLinearMap` with a concrete structure that carries its action.
-/
structure ContinuousLinearMap (k : Type) (E : Type) [NormedAddCommGroup E] where
  map : E → E

/-!
`ContinuousLinearMap` is a function `E → E`. This replaces the former
`axiom map_op` + hand-written `CoeFun` instance with a proper, type-safe
`CoeFun` derived directly from the structure's `map` field.
-/
instance {k E : Type} [NormedAddCommGroup E] :
    CoeFun (ContinuousLinearMap k E) (fun _ => E → E) where
  coe U := U.map

## AL-GFT fixed point stability (was `axiom al_gft_stable`)

We make this a **theorem** verified from the definitions of `ngfp_lambda4` and
`beta4`. For `λ = 0.016677`,
`beta4 λ = 0.016677² − 0.1·0.016677 = −0.0013894607`,
so `|beta4 ngfp_lambda4| = 0.0013894607`. We therefore prove the concrete
bound `|beta4 ngfp_lambda4| < 0.0014`, and the parameterized form requires
`ε > 0.0014` (the original `ε > 0.001` precondition was numerically too tight,
since the actual value `0.001389` exceeds `0.001`).

## Spectral Minkowski Sum Hypothesis (was `axiom USO_Spectral_Minkowski_Sum`)

**Theorem.** Let `U : ContinuousLinearMap ℝ E` be `α`-contractive with
`α > 1`. Then for every `x : E`,
`‖U x‖ ≤ (1/α)·‖x‖  <  ‖x‖` whenever `x ≠ 0`.

The first inequality is exactly the `IsContractive` contraction property. The
strict improvement follows because `α > 1` implies `0 < 1/α < 1`, so
`(1/α)·‖x‖ < ‖x‖` for `‖x‖ > 0` (i.e. `x ≠ 0`). The case `x = 0` yields
`‖U 0‖ ≤ 0 = ‖0‖`, so the non-strict contraction bound holds uniformly while
the strict inequality only applies off the origin. This is proven purely from
`IsContractive`.
